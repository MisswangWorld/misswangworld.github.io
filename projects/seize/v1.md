# Seize | Every Focused Moment

## Overview

**Seize** is a minimalist focus timer app that helps users track and record their focus sessions directly to their device calendar. The app combines the simplicity of a timer with powerful calendar integration, enabling users to visualize their productivity patterns over time through their existing calendar workflow.

The name "Seize" embodies the philosophy of seizing the moment and taking control of your time.

## Features

### Dual Timer Modes
- **Countdown Mode**: Set a specific duration for focused work sessions (similar to the Pomodoro Technique)
- **Count-up Mode**: Open-ended timer for tracking how long you've been focused without a preset limit

### Calendar Integration
- Automatically saves completed focus sessions as calendar events
- Creates a dedicated "Seize" calendar for organizing focus blocks
- Supports selecting from any writable calendar on the device
- Sessions include start time, end time, and actual focus duration (excluding pauses)

### Session Tagging
- Add custom tags to categorize your focus sessions (e.g., Work, Study, Reading)
- Smart tag suggestions based on usage history
- Tag history persists across sessions for quick selection

### Smart Notifications
- Push notifications alert you when countdown timers complete
- Works reliably even when the app is in the background
- Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation

### Responsive Design
- Adaptive layouts for both portrait and landscape orientations
- Optimized UI for tablets and phones
- Clean, distraction-free interface

### Dark Mode Support
- Automatic theme switching based on system preferences
- Carefully designed color palettes for both light and dark modes

### Internationalization
- Full support for English and Chinese (Simplified)
- Automatic language detection based on device settings

## Technology Highlights

### 1. React Native New Architecture
The app leverages React Native's new architecture (`newArchEnabled: true`), taking advantage of improved performance through:
- Fabric renderer for more responsive UI
- TurboModules for faster native module access
- Concurrent rendering capabilities

### 2. Lightweight State Management with Zustand
Instead of heavy solutions like Redux, the app uses Zustand for state management, providing:
- Minimal boilerplate with hook-based API
- TypeScript-first design with full type inference
- Separation of timer state and app-level state into focused stores
- Computed values (getElapsedSeconds, getRemainingSeconds) for derived state

### 3. Custom Hook Architecture
Complex timer logic is encapsulated in a custom `useTimer` hook that:
- Manages precise timing using timestamps (not intervals)
- Handles pause/resume with accurate pause duration tracking
- Coordinates notifications, haptics, and audio feedback
- Gracefully handles app state changes (foreground/background)

### 4. Cross-Platform Calendar Integration
The calendar service provides a unified API that:
- Creates platform-specific calendars (iOS CalDAV, Android local)
- Handles permission flows for both platforms
- Persists calendar IDs for consistent event creation
- Supports fallback to any user-selected calendar

### 5. Session Persistence & Recovery
Focus sessions are preserved across app restarts through:
- Pending session storage that captures timer state
- Timestamp-based calculation allowing accurate time recovery
- Local backup of all completed time blocks

### 6. File-Based Routing with Expo Router
Navigation structure is defined by the file system:
```
app/
├── _layout.tsx    # Root layout with providers
├── index.tsx      # Main timer screen
└── onboarding.tsx # First-time user experience
```

### 7. Theming System
A flexible theming system that:
- Automatically responds to system appearance changes
- Provides semantic color tokens (text, textSecondary, background)
- Maintains consistent brand colors across themes
- Uses React Context for efficient theme propagation

### 8. Modular Service Architecture
Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services:
- `calendarService.ts` - All calendar operations
- `notificationService.ts` - Push notification management
- `storageService.ts` - Persistent storage operations
